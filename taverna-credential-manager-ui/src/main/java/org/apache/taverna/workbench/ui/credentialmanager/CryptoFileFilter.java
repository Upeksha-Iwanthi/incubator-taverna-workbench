/**
 * File filter for filtering against various file extensions. Crypto files
 * normally contain a private key (and optionally its certificate chain) or a
 * public key certificate (and optionally its certificate chain).
 * 
 * .p12 or .pfx are PKCS #12 keystore files containing private key and its
 * public key (+cert chain); .pem are ASN.1 PEM-encoded files containing one (or
 * more concatenated) public key certificate(s); .der are ASN.1 DER-encoded
 * files containing one public key certificate; .cer are CER-encoded files
 * containing one ore more DER-encoded certificates; .crt files are either
 * encoded as binary DER or as ASCII PEM. .p7 and .p7c are PKCS #7 certificate
 * chain files (i.e. SignedData structure without data, just certificate(s)).
