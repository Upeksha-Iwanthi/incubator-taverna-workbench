/**
 * Manager that can handle {@link Edit edits} for a {@link WorkflowBundle}.
 * <p>
 * Edits to a workflow that are to be undoable or redoable should be created by
 * using {@link EditManager#getEdits()} to get an {@link Edits} object. Using
 * this to create {@link Edit}s, instead of calling {@link Edit#doEdit()}, use
 * {@link EditManager#doDataflowEdit(WorkflowBundle, Edit)} to associate the
 * edit with the specified Dataflow.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to undo a series of edits done on a particular dataflow in
 * this way by using {@link #undoDataflowEdit(WorkflowBundle)}. If one or more
 * undoes have been performed, they can be redone step by step using
 * {@link #redoDataflowEdit(WorkflowBundle)}. Note that it is no longer possible
 * to call {@link #redoDataflowEdit(WorkflowBundle)} after a
 * {@link #doDataflowEdit(WorkflowBundle, Edit)}.
 * <p>
 * The EditManager is {@link Observable}. If you
 * {@linkplain Observable#addObserver(net.sf.taverna.t2.lang.observer.Observer)
 * add an observer} you can be notified on {@linkplain DataflowEditEvent edits},
